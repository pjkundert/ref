The Enbridge Inc. &quot;REF&quot; C++ Reference Counting Pointer
Framework

</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>

REF provides much of the utility of automatic Garbage Collection,
without giving up the C/C++ pointer semantics and efficiency you are
used to, and without the non-deterministic overhead associated with
most GC schemes.

</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>

Unlike other C++ Reference Counting Pointer frameworks, REF:

</FONT></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>

	Requires no addition compilation or linkage to use.  It
	is implemented in a single standard C++ header file.

	</FONT></P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>

	Low size overhead.  A ref::ptr&lt;T&gt; implements
	ref::ptr_tiny&lt;T&gt;, and is the same size as a T *, except
	for one small shared reference counter object
	(containing a C++ virtual table pointer, a T * pointer, and an
	integer) allocated the first time a dynamically allocated T
	object is referenced by a ref::ptr&lt;T&gt;.  For improved
	efficiency, the reference counter can be easily added to the
	object itself, and ref::ptr automatically detects and uses it
	instead of allocating one.  Adding the ref::counter requires 3
	lines of code, or the use of a template at object allocation
	time.  A ref::ptr_fast&lt;T&gt; is the size of 2 pointers, but
	is 100% as fast as a normal pointer for dereferencing.

	</FONT></P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>

	Low speed overhead.  Access to the object involves 1 extra
	virtual method invocation in addition to the normal pointer
	dereference, and is similar whether you've added a
	ref::counter to the object, or are using the automatically
	allocated one.  Therefore, in most applications other than
	tight loops comprising millions of iterations accessing
	non-virtual methods or directly accessing the data members of
	the object, the ref::ptr&lt;T&gt; may be interchanged for a
	&lt;T *&gt;.  Otherwise, simply dereference the
	ref::ptr&lt;T&gt; into a temporary variable to type &lt;T
	&amp;&gt;, and use that in your central loop.  Or, substitute
	a ref::ptr_fast&lt;T&gt; in speed-critical loops.

	</FONT></P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>

	Maintains almost all normal C/C++ pointer semantics.  For
	example, both ref::ptr&lt;Base&gt; and ref::ptr&lt;Derived&gt;
	can reference the same underlying object of class Derived, and
	all the correct pointer conversions are used.

	</FONT></P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>

	Standard Template Library (STL) C++ Container friendly.
	Particularly useful when managing containers of dynamic
	objects.  As soon as the last container forgets about a
	particular object, it auto-destructs!  Imagine doing arbitrary
	std::set, std::map, or std::deque operations on containers of
	pointers to arbitrary objects, and never having to worry about
	deleting the objects when the containers are done with them.
	When they disappear from a std::set after a set operation, or
	when a std::map goes out of scope, the objects just disappear
	(unless some other ref::ptr still holds a reference.)

	</FONT></P>
</UL>

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>

One perceived drawback that ref::ptr's have relative to full-blown
Garbage Collection, is that co-referencing objects (objects that
retain references to each-other), can prevent auto-destruction.  This
is usually easily avoidable.  If you have objects containing
ref::ptr's to other objects, that eventually point back to the
original object, just make sure that one object breaks the
&quot;loop&quot; of linkage when no longer required; they will then
auto-destruct as appropriate.  Otherwise, ref::ptr's seem highly
efficient compared to most GC algorithms, are very safe and easy to
use, and yield virtually all of the simplicity benefits of GC, without
sacrificing space- or time- determinism.

</P>

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>

If your code must be very space- and time-efficient, or has
determinism requirements that cannot be met with the GC schemes
available to you, then REF is an excellent choice.  The space/time
efficiency tradeoff of using ref::ptr&lt;T&gt;/ref::ptr_tiny&lt;T&gt; (
1 x sizeof( T * ), but deference requires 1 virtual method invocation)
vs. ref::ptr_fast&lt;T&gt; ( 2 x sizeof( T * ), but dereference is
inlined) is totally within your control (see ref/ref.H).  Both the
&quot;small&quot; and &quot;fast&quot; versions are interchangable and
assignable.

</P>

<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=5>

<B>How-To</B>

</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>

Here is an example of 3 ref::ptr&lt;int&gt;'s, managing a couple of
dynamically allocated int objects.  In this example, since the new
&lt;int&gt; objects don't have their own ref::counter built in,
ref::ptr&lt;int&gt; allocates one (shared by all ref::ptr's sharing
the object).

</FONT></P>

<PRE STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">

#include &lt;ref&gt;

ref::ptr&lt;int&gt;		a( new int );		// new int 'A' on heap, 'a' holds ref::counter of 1 to 'A'
ref::ptr&lt;int&gt;		b;			// 'b's ref::counter is 0, and it's pointer ( *b, b-&gt;, ...) is 0.
b	= new int;				// new int 'B' on heap; 'b's ref::counter is 1
ref::ptr&lt;int&gt;		c;
c 	= b;					// 'b' and 'c' share ref::counter of 2 to 'B'
a	= c;					// 'A' freed; 'a', 'b' and 'c' share ref::counter of 3 to 'B'
</PRE>

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>

Basically, just ensure that any dynamically allocated &lt;object&gt;
is immediately assigned to a ref::ptr&lt;object&gt;.  Then, make sure
you only assign it between other ref::ptr's.  When the last ref::ptr
referencing it is assigned something else, the object will
auto-destruct.  Use the ref::ptr&lt;object&gt; as you would an (object
*).

</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT>

If you have control over the definition of a class, avoid allocating a
dynamic ref::counter for each new object of the class by adding a
built-in ref::counter: just add ref::counter&lt;your_class&gt; as
a(nother) base class, and one virtual method:
 
<PRE STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">

     class your_class 
         : public ref::counter&lt;your_class&gt {
         virtual your_class *__ref_getptr()  { return this; }
         /* ... the rest of your_class's declaration ... */
     }

</PRE>

To add a ref::counter to a class that you do NOT have control of
(named &quot;object&quot;, for example), derive a new class
&lt;rcobject&gt; from the base class &lt;object&gt; and also the
ref::counter&lt;rcobject&gt; base class, and add one new virtual
method (the ref::counter methods must be virtual, in order to maintain
proper pointer conversion and auto-destruction).  This new
&lt;rcobject&gt; is trivially convertible to &lt;object&gt;, and has a
built-in ref::counter, avoiding the additional dynamic allocation for
each new &lt;object&gt;:

</P>

<PRE STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">

class object { /* ... */ ; };

// Make an &quot;object&quot; having its own ref::counter; ref::ptr will use it..
class rcobject
  : public object
  , public ref::counter&lt;rcobject&gt; {
    virtual rcobject *__ref_getptr()  { return this; } // dereference the object
    /* ... */
};
ref::ptr&lt;rcobject&gt;	r = new rcobject;

</PRE>

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>

An alternative method for adding a ref::counter to &quot;object&quot; is to use the ref::dyn&lt;object&gt; template:

</FONT></P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">

// Add reference-counting and self-destruction to some other object
ref::ptr&lt;ref::dyn&lt;object&gt;&nbsp;&gt; o = new ref::dyn&lt;object&gt;	

</PRE>

<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>

In both of these cases, the ref::ptr's will automatically detect and
use the included ref::counter, instead of allocating one for each
shared object.  Use of ref::ptr's will be almost 100% as
space-efficient as using a raw pointer to the object (one &lt;int&gt;,
the reference counter, will be added to the size of the object)!  No
other dynamically or statically allocated objects of any kind are
required for any housekeeping.

</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=5>
<B>Other Implementations</B>
</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>

The implementation of boost::shared_ptr&lt;T&gt; is comparable to
ref::ptr_fast&lt;T&gt;.  The size of each boost::share_ptr is 2 x
sizeof( T * ), dereferencing is inlined (no virtual method invocations
required), and a shared_counter is dynamically allocated for each
group of shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;'s referencing a specific dynamically
allocated T object.

</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>

The benefits of REF are several.  First, the size of ref::ptr&lt;T&gt;
is 1 x sizeof( T * ), at the cost of 1 virtual method invocation per
dereference.  So, if your application stores many, many pointers, then
REF will cut your pointer storage space requirements by 50%.  There is
no equivalent in boost, that I am aware of.

</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>

Second, it appears that boost::shared_ptr <I>always</I> dynamically
allocates a shared_counter object, whenever one (or more) smart_ptr's
share a &lt;T&gt;.  If your program creates many, many small T's, then
the overhead of shared_counter allocated for each one will be
significant (potentially doubling your dynamic memory requirements).
Adding a ref::counter&lt;T&gt; as a base class of T will only increase
the size of T by 1 integer and a virtual table pointer (the shared
reference counter object).  No other objects are then required for
reference counting.  Again, there appears to be no equivalent in
boost.

</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>

Third, ref::ptr's are not thread-safe, and so do not have the overhead
of thread-safety built into each reference increment/decrement.  At
first this may not seem to be a benefit, but I believe that it is.
The details of transparently sharing dynamically allocated
reference-counted storage between threads have proven too great for
several widely supported implementations of std::string, produced by
people much smarter than me, and all have been abandoned.  Therefore,
you may <I>use</I> ref::ptr's in multiple threads without protection,
but <B><I>do not</I></B> assign or copy to/from them!  Remember,
copying one ref::ptr&lt;T&gt; to another involves a <I>write</I> to
the shared reference counter, and destruction of the copy later
involves another write!  If you do copy, then all accesses to all
copies must be encompassed by mutual exclusion intrinsics.  In other
words, treat them like any other shared object in the multi-threaded
environment.

</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>

Define the preprocessor symbol REF_PTR_DEREF_FAST (see the GNU Make
file <A HREF="../GNUmakefile">GNUmakefile</A> for an example ) to
globally force ref::ptr&lt;T&gt; to implement ref::ptr_fast&lt;T&gt;,
in applications where it is known in advance that speed is more
important than space, all source code is available, and where compiled
modules will never be shared outside of the compiled application.

</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>

Define the preprocessor symbol REF_PTR_COMPARE (see the GNU Make file
<A HREF="../GNUmakefile">GNUmakefile</A> for an example ) to define
functions that automatically compare ref::ptr&lt;T&gt; by their
underlying pointers.  This allows use of ref::ptr's as keys in sorted
containers.  If you wish to define such comparison methods yourself,
you must put them in the namespace 'ref', or they will be hidden
(probably by too many levels of template type deduction.)
